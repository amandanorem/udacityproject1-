Your response goes here!

I would say the newest skills I learned up to this point were the <b> and <sup> tags.
The parts I find easy is keeping the layout organized.  It helps me to read the codes better.
The difficult part that I ran into was during the figure's quiz.  I had to research for a while to find out what I was doing wrong, finally found what I had missed when I looked in the forum for help.
My problem strategies is to try and figure it out on my own first by reading the instructions.  The next step is research on the internet.  Then I use the community forum.
